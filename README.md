# What is this repo for ?
This repo contains javascript file to extract every Jacob's contest on Hypixel Skyblock.

## How it works
Using node.js and mineflayer package.
The bot is able to connect on mc.hypixel.net:25565, join Skyblock mode, open the in-game calendar and extract every Jacob's contest.



## How to run it
First you need to install Node.js.
Then run both commands in your terminal to install dependency
```bash
npm install mineflayer
npm install mineflayer-gui
```

Run main.js using
```bash
node main.js
```
Wait for several seconds/minutes (depending on your connection).
You follow the execution in the terminal.
When the script is done, you can find the result in the file result.txt next to main.js file

## How it collects the data
First the bot connect to Hypixel IP which is mc.hypixel.net:25565.
When he is connected, he will wait until a MVP+ or more join the server because when a MVP+ join there is this message : '[PSEUDO] slid into the lobby!'
When the script catch this message the bot run '/skyblock' to join obviously skyblock.
This technique is a way to not spam Hypixel server with command when it didn't join skyblock at first time.

Now the second main step is to open the in-game calendar. To do so we just as before wait for the in-game message 'Welcome to Skyblock!' send by the server single everytime you joined Skyblock. Then the bot type /calendar to open a GUI that you may know.
Then the script is looping into every item in the GUI and looking for a 'minecraft:clock' and click on it to more detailled calendar.
Like before, the script just go throught every item and get information about there such as Item Name and Item Lore which contain information about the Jacob's contest.
Et voil√†! We just have to save it into a file : result.txt
When no more page is found, that means we have reach the end of the year so we can leaved the server.



Because there is no way to get Jacob's contest event throught Hypixel API.
I have made a bot which analyse in-game GUI especially Item Name and Item Lore.
The Item Lore contains the list of crops for the contest.
